Why use --?
If you wrote:
cargo run sample.md sample.html

Cargo could treat sample.md and sample.html as its own arguments (e.g. package or binary names). 
Using -- makes it explicit: “everything after this is for my program, not for Cargo.”

In Rust, those show up in std::env::args():
args()[0] = binary name
args()[1] = "sample.md"
args()[2] = "sample.html"

So -- is the standard way to separate Cargo’s arguments from your CLI tool’s arguments.
