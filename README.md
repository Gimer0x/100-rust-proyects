# 100 Rust Projects

A collection of Rust exercises (d1–d100+) grouped in batches of 10. Each project focuses on a concrete task to practice different parts of the language and ecosystem.

**What’s covered:** basics (CLI, parsing, file I/O), error handling and custom types, concurrency and async, systems programming (processes, TCP, monitoring), networking (HTTP, WebSockets, APIs), data tools (CSV, TOML, compression), and later projects with WebAssembly, Docker, and API integrations.

No single “run everything” command—each exercise lives in its own folder (e.g. `3_Exercises/d21_error_handling/`). Open the one you care about and run it with `cargo run` or the instructions in that project.
